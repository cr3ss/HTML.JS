# [HTML.JS]

A React JS alternative with built in state management.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cr3ss/HTML.JS
```

* **Declarative:** HTML.JS allows you to build user interfaces in a simple and straightforward way. No more switching between files to work on a single piece (component). You can simply define everything about a particular piece within its own data.
* **Component-Based:** You can build components that make production of both the UI and other features modular, which speeds up development time, productivity, and allows you to reuse the same code throughout multiple projects as well as easily share code with others.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
